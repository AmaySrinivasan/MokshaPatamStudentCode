| Sept 4 |  9-10pm  |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        Became a bit confused with BFS implementation, so just started with the basic setup |
| Sept 7 |  8-9pm   |                                                                                                      I was just trying to grind out the BFS logic in my code. I had trouble at first figuring out how  wanted to setup the arrays and the board itself such that the queues would loop through the moves cleanly. It took a really long time to figure out placing an array of integers within the queue, but that really cleared things up for me. I didn't finish all of it in this attempt, but I think I setup the outline pretty well with the boards and the queues. |
| Sept 8 |  9-10pm  | Was able to complete a brute force version of the solution that actually compiled. I ran into this annoying issue where I didn't put my for loop inside my while, so it didn't loop properly. Because of this, I thought the problem was with my variable definitions, so that set me off course. Eventually, I realized the simple mistake with my brackets, and I fixed it to end up with a result that compiled. It might not be the most code efficient, but I essentially filled in the backbone I laid out yesterday in order to create a somewhat completed version |
