| Sept 3  |  2:30-3pm   |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       In class I tried to plan out my whole idea/approach to this question |
| Sept 4  |   9-10pm    |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        Became a bit confused with BFS implementation, so just started with the basic setup |
| Sept 7  |    8-9pm    |                                                                                                      I was just trying to grind out the BFS logic in my code. I had trouble at first figuring out how  wanted to setup the arrays and the board itself such that the queues would loop through the moves cleanly. It took a really long time to figure out placing an array of integers within the queue, but that really cleared things up for me. I didn't finish all of it in this attempt, but I think I setup the outline pretty well with the boards and the queues. |
| Sept 8  |   9-10pm    | Was able to complete a brute force version of the solution that actually compiled. I ran into this annoying issue where I didn't put my for loop inside my while, so it didn't loop properly. Because of this, I thought the problem was with my variable definitions, so that set me off course. Eventually, I realized the simple mistake with my brackets, and I fixed it to end up with a result that compiled. It might not be the most code efficient, but I essentially filled in the backbone I laid out yesterday in order to create a somewhat completed version |
| Sept 9  |  7-7:30pm   |                                                                                                                               Added in comments and went through my full code again to get a feel for where I could incroporate more runtime efficiency. Got a bit confused within my queue of arrays, but commenting it out helped clear it up for me. The comments also helped me identify points where my code might be unclear, so I wen tthrough and fixed that. COmmenting really helped me understand what I was doing a lot better and made everything far clearer |
| Sept 10 | 7:45-8:30pm |                                                                 Wrapped up the commenting part of things. ALso, called and discuessed with friends to make sure my code was running efficently and abstractly. Learned that they solved it a different way, but I am fairly sure we have the same runtime. Had to walk through my code several times to understand this. I think I approached it different after researching that you can have a queue of integer arrays, but it is effectively doing the same things. The comments have the code looking clean and nice.  |
